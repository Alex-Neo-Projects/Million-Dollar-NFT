# Million-Dollar-NFT [unfinished, unmaintained]

The Million dollar NFT homepage! 

This was a project created by Alex & Neo for an idea we called the "Million Dollar NFT". 

We wanted to create something like [The Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/) where each 10x10 pixel block was represented as an NFT you could buy/sell/trade or redeem. The idea was you could redeem the NFT in order to place a 10x10 image on the million pixel grid we created.

We ended up not continuing the project for three reasons: 
 1) It was extremely cost prohibitive to mint 10k NFTs on Ethereum at the current gas prices (3/21/21)
 2) We weren't able to figure out how to make Opensea's lazy minting work while hosting metadata with a decentralized network like Arweave or IPFS (all the examples on the Opensea tutorials just showed how to do it with creating a centralized self hosted metadata server. This defeats the purpose of an NFT). 
 3) It stopped being fun
